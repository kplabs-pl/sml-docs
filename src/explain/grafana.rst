Grafana
=======

Overview
---------

Instance of Grafana is available at https://grafana.vpn.sml.kplabs.space after logging with Customer Dashboard. It provides access to telemetry readouts from all subscribed boards - both currently active and any board subscribed previously. KP Labs provides basic set of dashboards for each board, but customer can also define their own dashboards as they see fit.

Smart Mission Lab stores telemetry readouts in Prometheus-compatible database which gives full support for PromQL queries.
